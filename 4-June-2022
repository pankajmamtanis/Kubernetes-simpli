Types of Cotrollers (controllers is an abstract layer that can create & manage  a group of pods)

replicaSet - allow no. of pods

daeomonset - one per node, monitoring AV etc

deployment - managing multiple replicaset, desired state - kind: Service

Job -  job starts and then stops . take DB backup every 3 hrs. kind: Job. backup, retries handled.

CronJob - https://crontab.guru/           kubectl get cj

-------------------------------

Volumes
- pod-container-tomcat-logs,data will be stored inside the cotainer by default. Banking example we cannot use such setup.
- data needs to be persistent
types of volumes
-------
1- emptyDirectory - emptyDir are volumes that get created empty when a Pod is created. While a Pod is running its emptyDir exists. If a container in a Pod crashes the emptyDir content is unaffected. Deleting a Pod deletes all its emptyDirs.
   - used for sharing the data between 2 containers within a Pod, single container used outside the container
   - is a non-persistent volume
   - gets created by k8s when pod is created
   - all data within would get deleted once we delete the pod
   - like pendrive connected to laptop for moving data, similarly emptyDir connected to container
   kubectl get pod <name-of-the-pod> -o yaml
   ------
2- Persistent Vol
  - hostpath - worker1 can only write and read on hostpath and only respective owner can.
  - Persistent volume claim - hotel room book and later claim example.
  /NFS/EBS/Azurefiles
  - PV - PVC - Deployment example - supproted - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/
  ----------------------
  
  Storage Class - we dont do PV, we just give a reference to GCP for creating storage there and then
 --------------------
  Dynamic Volume provisioning - then we dont provision Persisent volume, to avoid billing - charging.
  ---------------------
  Home work. https://github.com/lerndevops/educka/tree/master/5-storage/storageclass/nfs 
  ------------------------
  ConfigMap - A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables
  - environment specific config cannot be shipped with container, it has to go with configmap.
  - from file
  - from environment variables
  ---------------
  
  Secret - same as config map just that this keeps user/passwords. use base64 for encryption
  
--------------------

Networking
1- bridge - docker to docker communication will always work
2- none - its like wifi disconnected, IP not provided
3- host - outside to in and reverse will work, not 2 containers with same port can be done. it will exit
4 - docker swarm doing Overlay network which takes care of inter-VLAN comminication across VMs, just container has to be part of the overlay network
5- 

K8 netowkring
1- weave network - overlay
2- pause networking - same IP can be used with different ports 8080 for nginx 80 for tomcat etc. this is made possible with pause container.
